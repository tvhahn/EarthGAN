EarthGAN - Earth Mantle Surrogate Modeling
==============================

Building a surrogate model of the Earth's mantle convection with a generative adversarial network.

Progress updates, along with my thoughts, can be found in the [devlog](devlog/).

See how good (or bad, lol) the GAN currently is! Open up the Colab notebook below:
